# Customer-Churn-Prediction

About the Analysis: The primary purpose of this kernel is to practice and enhance my skills in data analysis.

This analysis focuses on the behavior of telecom customers who are more likely to leave the platform. I intend to find out the most striking behavior of customers through EDA and later on use some of the predictive analytics techniques to determine the customers who are most likely to churn.

About the data: (As provided in the overview/description)

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

Findings:

•	Gender - The churn percent is almost equal in case of Male and Females.
